        <h3>About Myself:</h3>
        <p>Hello!This is Raja Rajeshwari.I am currently pursuing my bachelors degree in the stream of 
            Information Technology in Panimalar institue of Technology.I am tech enthusiast who’s always curious to learn new stuff—whether it’s coding, designing websites, or just figuring out how things work.I enjoy working on creative projects, from UI/UX design to fun little coding challenges.

            Besides tech, I’m into painting, journaling, and binge-watching my favorite series . I also love spending time with friends, collecting aesthetic stickers, and occasionally turning into a mini Pinterest board.
            
            I believe in good vibes, honest work, and trying to grow a little every day.
